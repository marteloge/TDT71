\chapter*{Game Development - Harder Than You Think}
    
  \section*{Introduction}
  The hardest part of making a game has always been the engineering. In past times, game engineering was mainly about low-level optimization - writing code that would run quickly on the target computer, leveraging clever tricks whenever possible. But in the past ten years, games have ballooned in complexity.
